# MCreator Examples Projects
This is the official place to download the tutorial that I have covered for [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) on my YouTube channel called [NorthWestTrees Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8XYkALuEvGlKhza5Uyb7uQ).   
  
I started getting requests from people wanting access to the procedures in the workspace and ended up deciding to provide assets (textures, models, sounds) and MCreator files (workspaces and procedures) as part of the project download.   
  
This repository is not associated with Pylo or MCreator but does provide useful examples of things I have done in the past with the software. Feel free to use them however you like in your mods or projects.

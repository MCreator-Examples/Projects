# MCreator Examples Projects
This is the official place to download the tutorial that I have covered for [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) on my YouTube channel called [NorthWestTrees Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8XYkALuEvGlKhza5Uyb7uQ).   
  
I started getting requests from people wanting access to the procedures in the workspace and ended up deciding to provide assets (textures, models, sounds) and MCreator files (workspaces and procedures) as part of the project download.   
  
This repository is not associated with Pylo or MCreator but does provide useful examples of things I have done in the past with the software. Feel free to use them however you like in your mods or projects.

# News & Updates
## November 13th, 2023 - Workspace Issues With 1.20.X And Above
> In some cases, the workspace may break when porting versions equal to or higher than 1.20. This is due to Mojang removing support for being able to test for the block's material type.   
>   
> Due to this change, MCreator had to also drop support as this was not a feature in newer versions of the game. With this said I have opened a forum post on my website [northwesttreesgaming.com](https://www.northwesttreesgaming.com/forum/mcreator/report-broken-workspaces-for-1-20-1) so that you can let me know of any broken workspaces.  
>   
> Keep in mind that I will only be fixing the latest version of projects as I don't have the time to update older workspaces that may have other issues with newer versions of the game. You can find more information on the forum post listed above.

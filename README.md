# MCreator Examples Projects
This is the official place to download tutorial that I have covered for MCreator on my YouTube channel called [NorthWestTrees Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8XYkALuEvGlKhza5Uyb7uQ).   
  
I started getting requests for people wanting access for the procedures in the workspace and ended up deciding to provide assets (textures, models, sounds) and MCreator files (workspaces and procedures) part of the project download.   
  
This repository is not assoiated with Pylo or MCreator but does provide useful examples of things I have done in the past with the software. Feel free to use them how ever you like in your mods or projects.

## DISCLAIMER
This is not an official repository of PYLO or MCreator and is maintained by NorthWestTrees Gaming. These workspaces and project files are designed for the versions of MCreator that they were made on and may not work in newer versions of the software.
